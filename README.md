# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Performance Dataset

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Students Performance in Exams** dataset from Kaggle using **Python**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding score distributions, gender-wise performance, subject correlations, and the impact of external factors such as lunch type.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand the structure and patterns in student exam data
- Analyze performance differences across subjects
- Identify relationships between Math, Reading, and Writing scores
- Visualize trends using statistical plots
- Gain insights before applying machine learning models

---
