# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Performance Dataset

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Students Performance in Exams** dataset from Kaggle using **Python**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding score distributions, gender-wise performance, subject correlations, and the impact of external factors such as lunch type.
